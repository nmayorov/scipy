    """Minimize the sum of squares of nonlinear functions subject to bound
    constraints on independent variables.

    Let f(x) maps from R^n to R^m, this function finds a local minimum of::

        F(x) = ||f(x)||**2 = sum(f_i(x)**2, i = 1, ..., m),
        s. t. lb <= x <= ub,

    f(x) is called vector of residuals or simply residuals.

    Partial derivatives of f with respect to x form m-by-n matrix called
    Jacobian, where an element (i, j) equals to a partial derivative of f[i]
    with respect to x[j].

    Parameters
    ----------
    fun : callable
        Function which computes a vector of residuals. The argument x passed
        to this function is ndarray of shape (n,) (never a scalar, even
        if n=1). It must return 1-d array_like of shape (m,) or a scalar.
    x0 : array_like of shape (n,) or float
        Initial guess on independent variables. If float, for internal usage
        it will be converted to 1-d array.
    jac : '2-point', '3-point' or callable, optional
        Method of computing the Jacobian matrix. If set to '2-point' or
        '3-point', the Jacobian matrix is estimated by the corresponding
        finite difference scheme. The scheme '3-point' is more accurate, but
        requires twice as much operations compared to '2-point' (default).
        If callable, then it should return a reasonable approximation of
        Jacobian as array_like with shape (m, n) (np.atleast_2d is applied in
        'trf' and 'dogbox' methods). Only for 'lm' method: callable must
        return 2-d ndarray, if you set ``col_deriv=1`` in `options` then a
        callable must return transposed Jacobian.
    bounds : 2-tuple of array_like, optional
        Lower and upper bounds on independent variables. Defaults to no bounds.
        Each array must match the size of `x0` or be a scalar, in the latter
        case a bound will be the same for all variables. Use ``np.inf`` with
        an appropriate sign to disable bounds on all or some variables.
    method : {'trf', 'dogbox', 'lm'}, optional
        Algorithm to perform optimization.

            * 'trf' - Trust Region Reflective algorithm, particularly suitable
              for large sparse problems with bounds. Generally robust method.
            * 'dogbox' - dogleg algorithm with rectangular trust regions,
              typical use case is small problems with bounds. Not recommended
              to use in rank-deficient problems.
            * 'lm' - Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as implemented in MINPACK.
              Doesn't handle bounds and sparse Jacobians, but usually most
              efficient for small unconstrained problems.

        Default is 'trf'. See Notes and algorithm options for more information.
    ftol : float, optional
        Tolerance for termination by the change of the objective value.
        Default is square root of machine epsilon. See the exact meaning in
        documentation for a selected `method`.
    xtol : float, optional
        Tolerance for termination by the change of the independent variables.
        Default is square root of machine epsilon. See the exact meaning in
        documentation for a selected `method`.
    gtol : float, optional
        Tolerance for termination by the norm of gradient. Default is
        square root of machine epsilon. In presence of bounds more correctly
        to call it first-order optimality threshold, as a raw gradient
        itself doesn't measure optimality. See the exact meaning in
        documentation for a selected `method`.
    max_nfev : None or int, optional
        Maximum number of function evaluations before the termination.
        If None (default) each algorithm uses its own default value.
    scaling : array_like or 'jac', optional
        Applies variables scaling to potentially improve algorithm convergence.
        Default is 1.0 which means no scaling. Scaling should be used to
        equalize the influence of each variable on the objective function.
        Alternatively you can think of `scaling` as diagonal elements of
        a matrix which determines the shape of a trust region. Use smaller
        values for variables which have bigger characteristic scale compared
        to others. A scalar value won't affect the algorithm (except maybe
        fixing/introducing numerical issues and changing termination criteria).
        If 'jac', then scaling is proportional to the norms of Jacobian
        columns. The latter option is often helpful in unconstrained problems,
        but not so much in constrained ones. From experience usage of 'jac'
        scaling is not recommended for bounded problems with 'trf' method.
    diff_step : None or array_like, optional
        Determines the step size for finite difference Jacobian approximation.
        The actual step is computed as ``x * diff_step``. If None (default),
        `diff_step` is assigned to a conventional "optimal" power of machine
        epsilon depending on a finite difference approximation method [NR]_.
    tr_solver : {None, 'exact', 'lsmr'}, optional
        Method for solving trust-region subproblems, relevant only for 'trf'
        and 'dogbox' methods.

            * 'exact' is suitable for not very large problems, which have
              dense Jacobian matrices. It requires work comparable to a single
              SVD of Jacobian per iteration.
            * 'lsmr' is suitable for problems with sparse and large Jacobian
              matrices. It uses iterative ``scipy.sparse.linalg.lsmr``
              procedure for finding a solution of linear least squares and
              requires only matrix-vector product evaluations.

        If None (default) the solver is chosen based on type of Jacobian
        returned on the first iteration.
    tr_options : dict, optional
        Keyword options passed to trust-region solver.

            * `'tr_solver='exact'` : `tr_options` are ignored.
            * ``tr_solver='lsmr'`` : options for ``scipy.sparse.linalg.lsmr``.
               Additionally  ``method='trf'`` supports 'regularize' option
               (bool, default True) - add regularization term to the normal
               equation, which improves convergence with rank-deficient
               Jacobian [Byrd]_ (eq. 3.4).

    jac_sparsity : {None, array_like, sparse matrix}, optional
        Defines Jacobian sparsity structure for finite differencing (relevant
        when `jac` is '2-point' or '3-point'). Provide this parameter to
        greatly speed up finite difference Jacobian estimation, if it has only
        few non-zeros in *each* row [Curtis]_. Should be array_like or sparse
        matrix with shape (m, n). A zero element means that a corresponding
        element in Jacobian is identically zero.  Forces `tr_solver` to 'lsmr'
        if it wasn't set. If None (default) then dense differencing will be
        used.
    args, kwargs : tuple and dict, optional
        Additional arguments passed to `fun` and `jac`. Both empty by default.
        The calling signature is ``fun(x, *args, **kwargs)`` and the same for
        `jac`. Method 'lm' can't handle `kwargs`.
    options : dict, optional
        Additional options passed to a chosen method. Empty by default.
        The calling sequence is ``method(..., **options)``. Look for relevant
        options in documentation for a selected method.

    Returns
    -------
    OptimizeResult with the following fields defined.
    x : ndarray, shape (n,)
        Found solution.
    obj_value : float
        Sum of squares at the solution.
    fun : ndarray, shape (m,)
        Vector of residuals at the solution.
    jac : ndarray, shape (m, n)
        Jacobian matrix at the solution.
    optimality : float
        First-order optimality measure. In unconstrained problems it is always
        the uniform norm of the gradient. In constrained problems this is the
        quantity which was compared with `gtol` during iterations, refer
        to options of a selected method.
    active_mask : ndarray of int, shape (n,)
        Each component shows whether a corresponding constraint is active
        (a variable is on the bound):

            *  0 - a constraint is not active.
            * -1 - a lower bound is active.
            *  1 - an upper bound is active.

        Might be somewhat arbitrary for 'trf' method as it does strictly
        feasible iterates and `active_mask` is determined with tolerance
        threshold.
    nfev : int
        Number of function evaluations done. Methods 'trf' and 'dogbox' don't
        count function calls for numerical Jacobian approximation, opposed to
        'lm' method.
    njev : int or None
        Number of Jacobian evaluations done. If numerical Jacobian
        approximation is used in 'lm' method, it is set to None.
    status : int
        Reason for algorithm termination:

            * -1 - improper input parameters status returned from `leastsq`.
            *  0 - the maximum number of function evaluations is exceeded.
            *  1 - `gtol` termination condition is satisfied.
            *  2 - `ftol` termination condition is satisfied.
            *  3 - `xtol` convergence test is satisfied.
            *  4 - Both `ftol` and `xtol` termination conditions are satisfied.

    message : string
        Verbal description of the termination reason.
    success : int
        True if one of the convergence criteria is satisfied.
    x_covariance : ndarray with shape (n, n) or None
        Estimate of x covariance assuming that residuals are uncorrelated
        and have unity variance. It is computed as the inverse of J.T*J where
        J is Jacobian matrix. If 'trf' or 'dogbox' method are used or the
        inverse doesn't exist this field is set to None.

    Notes
    -----
    Method 'lm' (Levenberg-Marquardt) calls a wrapper over least-squares
    algorithms implemented in MINPACK (lmder, lmdif). It runs
    Levenberg-Marquadrd algorithm formulated as a trust-region type algorithm.
    The implementation is based on paper [JJMore]_, it is very robust and
    efficient with a lot of smart tricks. It should be your first choice
    for unconstrained problems. Note that it doesn't support bounds. Also
    it doesn't work when n < m.

    Method 'trf' (Trust Region Reflective) is motivated by the process of
    solving a system of equations, which constitutes the first-order optimality
    condition for a bound-constrained minimization problem as formulated in
    [STIR]_. The algorithm iteratively solves trust-region subproblems
    augmented by special diagonal quadratic term with trust-region shape
    determined by the distance from the bounds and the direction of the
    gradient. This enhancements help not to take steps directly into bounds
    and explore the whole variable space. To improve convergence speed the
    reflected from the first bound search direction is considered. To obey
    theoretical requirements the algorithm keeps iterates strictly feasible.
    Trust-region subproblems are solved by exact method very similar to one
    described in [JJMore]_ and implemented in MINPACK, but with the help of
    one per iteration singular value decomposition of the Jacobian matrix.
    The algorithm's performance is generally comparable to MINPACK in
    unbounded problems. The algorithm works quite robust in unbounded and
    bounded problems, thus it is chosen as a default algorithm.

    Method 'dogbox' operates in a trust-region framework, but considers
    rectangular trust regions as opposed to conventional elliptical [Voglis]_.
    The intersection of a current trust region and initial bounds is again
    rectangular, so on each iteration a quadratic minimization problem subject
    to bounds is solved. Powell's dogleg method [NumOpt]_ is applied to solve
    these subproblems. The algorithm is likely to exhibit slow convergence
    when the rank of Jacobian is less than the number of variables.
    The algorithm often outperform 'trf' in bounded problems with small number
    of variables.
